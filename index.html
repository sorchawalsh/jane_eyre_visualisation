<h1>Length of each sentence by chapter of Jane Eyre</h1>
<p>Jane Eyre is a novel which, in the Gothic tradition, is known for being gloomy
However, Jane and the other characters in the novel do end up knowing several
    moments of true happiness. The aim of this project was to visualise these.</p>
<p>This graph is comprised of 38 smaller graphs, with the 0th one being the prologue.
Each line represents a sentence, and its length is the number of words in the sentence.
The colour of the line is based on the sentiment, obtained via sentiment analysis using
    TextBlob.</p>
   <p> Sentiment analysis, while a flawed tool in individual cases,
allows for an overview of the shape of the novel, mood-wise, to be obtained.
The darker areas represent areas with lighter mood, whereas the lighter areas represent
   those with a more negative sentiment score.</p>
<p>Mouse over each chapter to see the most positive and negative sentence in each,
with their associated scores.</p>
